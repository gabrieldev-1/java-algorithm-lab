# Java Algorithm Lab 🚀

A personal repository to document my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.

## 📌 About this Project
This is a collection of manual implementations created from scratch. The goal is to understand the logic behind common algorithms and how data is structured in memory.

## 📂 Content

### 1. Algorithms
- **Sorting:** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Searching:** (e.g., Binary Search)

### 2. Data Structures
- **Linear:** Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
- **Non-Linear:** Trees, Hash Tables.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Java 17 or higher.
- A Java IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, or Eclipse).
