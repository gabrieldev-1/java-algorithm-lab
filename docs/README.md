# Java Algorithm Lab

**Java Algorithm Lab** is a study laboratory focused on the manual implementation of classic data structures and algorithms in Java.

This project has three main objectives:

1. **To document my learning process in an organized way**, consolidating core knowledge of data structures and algorithms.  
2. To serve as a **technical showcase of my skills**, demonstrating practical understanding of how structures work internally.  
3. To help other students who want to understand how these structures operate beneath the abstractions of the standard library.

This repository does not rely on Java’s built-in implementations (such as `HashMap`, `LinkedList`, etc.) for the core structures — the focus is to understand and build the logic manually.

# 🧠 Project Philosophy

The goal is not just to *use* data structures, but to:

- Implement them from scratch  
- Manually manipulate references/pointers  
- Handle collisions in hashing  
- Manage chaining  
- Control time and space complexity  
- Understand amortized behavior  

Each structure was built with clarity and internal mechanics in mind.
